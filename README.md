## GANs Project: Face Generation

The project files were located in the Project Workspace of Udacity forum and included the following files:

* **`dlnd_face_generation_starter.ipynb`**
* **`README.md`**
* **`requirements.txt`**
* **`tests.py`**
* **`processed-celeba-small.zip`**

### Instructions

The project was completed in the file `dlnd_face_generation_starter.ipynb`. This project was organized as follows:

* **Data Pipeline**: implemented a data augmentation function and a custom dataset class to load the images and transform them.
* **Model Implementation**: built a custom generator and a custom discriminator to make my custom GAN
* **Loss Functions and Gradient Penalty**: design decision made on loss functions and then also used gradient penalty for the discriminator step.
* **Training Loop**: implemented the training loop and performed hyperparameter tunings to achieve the expected accuracy of the model.

Each section required me to make design decisions based on the experience I have gathered from the course.   

Building a deep learning model is an iterative process, and it's especially true for GANs! Therefore, I thoroughly enjoyed the process and I learned how to implement it from the scratch, which provided me an indepth of the concepts, that I learned from the course.
